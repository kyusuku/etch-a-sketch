# Etch A Sketch 🎨🖌️  

**Etch A Sketch** is a browser-based drawing app created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project** curriculum. This is my fourth project, focusing on **DOM manipulation and event handling** in JavaScript. The project allows users to draw by hovering over a grid while experimenting with different grid sizes and colors.  

---  

## How to Use  

1. Move your mouse over the grid to **draw**.  
2. Each square changes color randomly when hovered over.  
3. Click **"Set up new grid!"** to choose a new grid size (up to 100x100).  
4. The grid will reset, allowing you to create a new drawing.

## Try It Out  

You can test the Etch A Sketch app here: [Etch A Sketch](https://kyusuku.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

## Features  

- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** Users can choose grid sizes between **1x1 and 100x100**.  
- **Hover-to-Draw Effect:** The grid squares change color as you move the mouse over them.  
- **Randomized Colors:** Each hover event applies a new random color.  
- **Opacity Effect:** Colors darken progressively with each pass.

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure of the app.  
- **CSS3:** Styles the layout and improves user experience.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles grid generation, user interactions, and color changes.

## Project Structure  

### Files and Directories  
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.  
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for page layout and UI design.  
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that controls the game logic and interactivity.

## Learning Objectives  

This project was built with the following objectives:  
1. **Understanding DOM Manipulation:** Creating and updating elements dynamically.  
2. **Event Handling:** Implementing mouse hover interactions for a responsive UI.  
3. **Grid-Based Layouts:** Using CSS Flexbox to create a dynamic sketching area.  
4. **User Input Handling:** Accepting user-defined grid sizes via prompts.  

---  

## Future Improvements  

- **Eraser Tool:** Allow users to remove color from squares.  
- **Color Picker:** Let users choose a fixed color instead of random colors.  
- **Save & Load Drawings:** Implement a feature to save and reload sketches.  
- **Touchscreen Support:** Improve functionality for mobile users.

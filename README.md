# 🎨 Etch A Sketch 🖌️  

**Etch A Sketch** is a browser-based drawing app created as part of my journey through **The Odin Project** curriculum. This is my fourth project, focusing on **DOM manipulation and event handling** in JavaScript. The project allows users to draw by hovering over a grid while experimenting with different grid sizes and colors.

## 🕹️ How to Use  

1. 🖱️ Move your mouse over the grid to **draw**.  
2. 🎨 Each square changes color randomly when hovered over.  
3. ⚙️ Click **"Set up new grid!"** to choose a new grid size (up to **100x100**).  
4. 🔄 The grid will reset, allowing you to create a new drawing.
